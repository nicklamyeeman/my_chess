<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a personnal project. The goal is to recreate the famous chess game.
The game is still under developpement. The project purpose was to handle the mouse event in ncurses and later on be able to create an online ncurses game.
The ultimate goal will be to create my own AI playing chess. But nowadays, I don't have that much time for this little side project

![gameplay](https://github.com/nicklamyeeman/my_sokoban/blob/main/ressources/readme/gameplay.gif)

The game is playable like a board that you have at home. No check, no game over. Just restart the program to restart the game.

### CUSTOMIZATION

Everything in the ```ressources/pieces``` and the ```ressources/board.txt``` can be changed for anything you want.
However, you might keep the same size of the your tiles if you want a coherent board and game.
